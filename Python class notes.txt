Have a brief QandA session regarding todays lecture and Python questions in general


The purpose of the group is to teach python to non software people to maximize productivity,
automate some of their workload and simple data analysis.

Some of the audience can be, finance, economics, business, computationally intensive sciences

Agenda:

What are strings b '', r'', u''
r-strings or r' '
regular expression characters should not be interpreted: \n, \t
Strings are immutable. Once you create a string you can't change/modify it.
When you modify strings you create new objects
can use single or double quotes
astring = "Isn't it cool to learn Python"
how to use ' '.join()

Purpose of the group is NOT for you to get a job as a software engineer,
but to be able to apply the knowledge and techniques to add value to your current role.

Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created (Java strings also use this immutable style).
 Since strings can't be changed, we construct *new* strings as we go to represent computed values. So for example the expression ('hello' + 'there') takes in the 2 strings 'hello' and 'there' and builds a new string 'hellothere'.
